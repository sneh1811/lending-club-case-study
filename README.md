## General Information
### Project Information
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of loan data obtained from a consumer finance company. The dataset includes complete loan data for loans issued over a period from 2007 to 2011.

### Project Understanding
The primary goal of this project is to gain insights into the factors that influence loan defaults. To achieve this, the project entails an in-depth analysis of historical loan applicant data to assess their probability of default.

### Problem Statement
The central issue addressed in this project is the need to identify high-risk loan applicants who are likely to default on their loans. The ultimate aim is to minimize credit loss for the lending company by making informed lending decisions and mitigating financial risks.


## Conclusions
* Through the analysis, it is evident that specific borrower characteristics and conditions are closely associated with a higher likelihood of loan defaults. These factors include homeownership status, loan purpose, interest rates, income levels, the number of open accounts, employment history, funding amounts, loan amounts, debt-to-income ratios, monthly installments, loan terms, loan status, recent inquiries, and loan grades.

* Loans issued during the latter months of the year have a higher likelihood of default, indicating a temporal dimension to loan defaults.

* In a bivariate analysis of charged-off loans, certain conditions such as 'home improvement' loans with specific income ranges, 'MORTGAGE' as homeownership status with particular income levels, and interest rates in certain ranges are associated with higher default probabilities.

* The identification of risky loan applicants, those likely to default, is crucial in reducing credit loss for lending companies. Understanding the driving factors behind loan defaults is essential for portfolio management and risk assessment.
